### Inverting SVG elements

In this brief post we will continue experimenting wiht the SVG's capabilities  and see if we can invert an element. Sadly for us, there is no such thing as an "invert" transformation, but we do have an `scale()` parameter that we can use to achieve the same effect. `scale()` only allows ranges from `1` to `-1`, where `1` will do nothing on that axis, `0` will make it infinitely thin, to the point of dissapearing completely, and `-1` will actually flip it. There is one caveat, though. The flipping depends on where the element's axis is, which usually is on its top left corner if such element was not created in a vector graphic software, as we talked about earlier. This means that in most cases, when you apply a `scale()`, the element will also be translated, so we have to make the same type of correction we do when rotating, but this time using the element's `x` and `y` attributes becuase these ones, contrary to `translate()`, allows us to use values in percentages.

```xml
<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Make graphic stretchable with <symbol>. -->
  <symbol id='vertical-side' width='16.25px' height='100%' viewBox='0 0 16.25 905' preserveAspectRatio='none'>
    <!-- Create and rotate graphic. -->
    <path transform='rotate(-90) translate(-905 0)' fill='#442d18' d='m 0,0 c 301.53,5.7865 603.05,5.7864 904.58,0 l 0,11.9 C 603.1,17.691 301.57,17.692 0,11.9 Z'/>
  </symbol>

  <!-- Use rotated graphic for the left side and an inverted copy for the righ side. -->
  <use xlink:href='#vertical-side'/>
  <use xlink:href='#vertical-side' x='-100%' transform='scale(-1 1)'/>
</svg>
```
Using the rotated side as an example, here we apply a `scale()` transform and set its `x` to `-100%` to move it back to its right location. The final result should look like this:
